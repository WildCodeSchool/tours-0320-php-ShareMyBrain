# SHAREMYBRAIN

## Description

This repository is based on a simple PHP MVC structure from scratch.

It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig and Grumphp.
For this one, just a simple example where users can choose one of their databases and see tables in it.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PWD', 'your_db_password');
```
4. If you have already import a BDD manually for this project, DELETE first manually the old BDD. then import `DBD-SHAREMYBRAIN-v2.sql` in your SQL server.
5. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
7. From this starter kit, create your own web application.
